PLEASE READ!

Go to: Writer Directory -> dist and then grab writer.exe and drop it in Writer Directory so the file you create will be in this directory.


WHAT CAN THIS THINGY DO?

It jsut creates a txt file and by writing something in the console it will be stored in this file. That simple.
